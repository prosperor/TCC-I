abstract = {The cloud music teaching learning and development of students and the lack of demand for mobile learning resource platform, this article focuses on the design and implementation of a mobile classroom in the cloud computing platform, a detailed analysis from four aspects: the background significance, platform design, architecture and main cloud technology application, the proposed system Flexible expansion module option information during transport and through the expansion towards the outside Prime work Mongo Pitty incorporate mapping. And previous system music teaching database work not load to cloud so to implementation Description of management. Music sharing and social functioning, communication across cultural boundaries between the language and the People, and through the development of neural networks, it has been upgraded from the choice of music discovery mode music cloud database under traditional record player mode. In this study, the social needs of the user's choice of music based on emotion net facilitate cloud music reviews for the dataset. Application Test actual teaching shows that the platform can meet the individual learning needs of students, enhance the interaction between teachers and students to achieve the flow of music teaching resources, sharing and fragmented organization. Cloud storage offers storage space, so primarily storage of user-friendly and timely acquisition and data, based Web user cloud-based applications of all types. The requirements for how to optimize cloud storage, in-depth analysis to improve data access and storage performance of the aims.}
